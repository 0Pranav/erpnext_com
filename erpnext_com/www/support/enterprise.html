2.3 Bug Fix Support
The Frappe team is actively involved in maintaining the stable version of ERPNext and will offer priority bug fix support on your instance as long as it is of a supported version.

Despite best efforts, sometimes bugs can get introduced in the system at the time of upgrade or on edge cases that are not handled by the system. In either case, the Frappe support team will work with the Core team developers to fix your bug based on the severity and priority, so that you face minimum downtime.

If you are on a stable release, you must upgrade to the latest version of that release. Selective patches cannot be applied as it will compromise the integrity of the system and potentially introduce many more issues.
