##### Q. How is the fees calculated for the number of users?
You only pay for the number of System users in your accounts. These are the users who can access the core modules of the ERP and not just portal views. 

A system user is generally someone with system roles like manager in Sales/Purchase/Manufacturing/HR, Leave Approver, Employee, Auditor, etc. These roles are assigned from the user's settings page.

##### Q. I'm going to have a large number of users on the cloud. Can I avail a bulk discount?
Not unless you have 100+ users. If so, you may also be interested in our <a href="https://erpnext.com/support">Enterprise plan</a>. 

##### Q. What am I paying for here?

* Hosting, backups, and storage managed by us.
* Priority functional support by the team that made ERPNext.
* Your own subdomain (with a choice of accessing via your custom domain).
* Bug Fixing guarantee.

##### Q. I want to host ERPNext on my own server but need your support. Is this possible?
Check out our <a href="https://erpnext.com/support">support plan</a> for details.

##### Q. How to proceed with the subscription payment?
You can pay for your ERPNext account from the application itself! Go to **My Account > Upgrade**.

You can pay for your subscription via Paypal or Credit card. If not, there's always Wire Transfer! Details for the same can be found <a href="https://erpnext.com/pricing/payment">here</a>

##### Q. Do I need to have a Paypal Account for subscription?
We use Paypal as our payment gateway to handle international subscriptions. You do not need to have a Paypal account for continuing with the subscription.

##### Q. I am running out of storage space/need to add more users. How do I go about doing so?
You can add more space/users from within your account. Just go to **My Account > Upgrade > Purchase Add-ons**. 

You can also upgrade your current plan in the same manner.

##### Q. I have already subscribed and I want to pay for the next month, however I don’t see a payment option, how so?
If you’ve paid via credit card or paypal for your subscription, the next payment will be auto-debited. In case there is an issue, get in touch with our support team.

##### Q. Is the cost of implementation covered in the subscription plan? 
The subscription plan covers support and hosting cost. You can avail implementation services by opting for a consultation plan or by contacting an <a href="https://erpnext.com/partners">ERPNext Partner</a>.

##### Q. I’m an Indian user and would like to subscribe using my Debit Card. Is this possible?
Currently, recurring payments are allowed on Mastercard and Visa network cards issued by ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Citibank and Canara Bank, provided the customer authorizes the first transaction through a normal Two-Factor Authentication/3DSecure flow.

##### Q. What happens to my data after subscription?
Your account is not reset after subscription and the data will remain as is. In case you would like to delete all transactions, you can view <a href="https://erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/articles/delete-a-company-and-all-related-transactions">this link</a>.

If you would like to completely reset your account, contact our <a href="mailto: support@erpnext.com">support team</a>.
