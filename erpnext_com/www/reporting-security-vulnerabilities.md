#Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
<br>
<p class='p' style='margin-bottom: 0;'>
While we try to be proactive in preventing security problems, we do not assume theyâ€™ll never come up.
</p>
<p class='p' style='margin-bottom: 0;'>
It is standard practice to responsibly and privately disclose a security problem to the vendor i.e. Frappe core development team before publicising, so a fix can be prepared, and damage from the vulnerability minimised.
</p>
